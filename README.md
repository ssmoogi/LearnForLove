PixelHacks IV Hackathon 2020 Project <br>

### inspiration
In the Bay Area, we are fortunate enough to have grown up in a place so culturally diverse and we have had opportunities that many do not. Our team made it our mission to help others be more open-minded towards people different from themselves in order to promote inclusiveness.

### what it does
Users can explore the map on our site to learn about a place's culture, traditions, foods, etc and see what makes it so unique. The site is interactive and engages users in many ways. Aimed towards students, teachers, and tourists, we hope our site gives them a way to learn and explore other cultures and familiarize themselves with another place they're interested in visiting someday.

### how we built it
We used html & css to build the site, and along the way attempted to incorporate it with the BlockStock (JS Framework that uses React) to allow users to involve themselves with the content of the site, but didn't end up completing that successfully and instead went with our original base site.

### challenges we ran into
At the start overestimated our combined coding abilities and therefore had to modify our project from our initial design. As we all had never been to a hackathon, had little coding experience, and never used a JS Framework before, this project was not easy.

### accomplishments we're proud of
We completed a (mostly) functional website in 24 hours! This was our group's first hackathon and we came up with an idea we are both passionate about and very proud of.

### what we learned
We learned how to improvise and make our ideas more realistic for different time constraints. We further developed our collaboration and design thinking skills. Our coding and presentation skills also grew through this project, and the things we learned we will never forget.

### what's next for learn for love
As time goes on, we hope to add more information to places and add more interactive activities. While using BlockStack we encountered many problems and weren't able to complete what we hoped. Later on, we would expand the site using this framework to allow locals to edit and add the site, and for general users to mark their favorite places and meet local people in the country if going on vacation. We are excited about the future of Learn for Love!
